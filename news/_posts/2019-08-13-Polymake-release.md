This is to announce the release of polymake 3.5. Major new features are:

* A new interface to FLINT which is, so far, used for fast univariate 
  polynomial arithmetic.
* New object type for slack ideals.
* New object type for hyperplane arrangements.

There are also many smaller fixes and improvements, see the [release
notes](https://polymake.org/doku.php/news/release_3_5) for more details.
